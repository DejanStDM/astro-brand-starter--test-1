# Astro Brand Starter Test 1

This is the first testing project that uses an Astro starter project with an updated Figma file for brand website development and Builder.io integration.

## Figma:

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

This project uses Astro for component-driven development and Vite for fast builds and hot reload. The goal is to create HTML, SCSS, and JS that can be easily copy-pasted into other systems (e.g., Drupal themes) after build. There is no direct Drupal integration in this project.


## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |




## âš¡ Workflow

- **Install dependencies:**
  ```sh
  npm install
  ```
- **Start dev server:**
  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```
  - Edits to `.astro`, `.scss`, or `.js` files are hot-reloaded.
- **Build for production:**
  ```sh
  npm run build
  ```
  - Outputs static HTML, CSS, and JS to `/dist`.

## ðŸ“¦ Using the Output

- After building, copy the HTML, CSS, and JS from `/dist` into your target system (e.g., a Drupal theme).
- This project does **not** handle Drupal integration or deploymentâ€”just asset generation.
