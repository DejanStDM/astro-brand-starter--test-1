                  Tea contains antioxidants called polyphenols that may help protect against cell damage. Green tea in particular is rich in catechins, which have been studied for their potential health benefits. However, tea should be part of a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle.

                  The main difference is in the processing. Black tea leaves are fully oxidized, giving them a stronger flavor and darker color. Green tea leaves are minimally processed and retain more of their natural antioxidants, resulting in a lighter, more delicate taste.
